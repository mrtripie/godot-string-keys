#TODO: 
#Maybes:
#	See if you can ensure there is no duplicate keys, even when not in alphabetical order (without complicating things)
#	Presets so you can have multiple files scanning different key types (wont work with modified files w/o a redesign though)
#	See if you can find a way to deal with a way to deal with modified when different settings come in to play
#	Optimize options
#	Figure out how it can check binary files such as .vs visual scripts or binary .scn and .res

#LIKELY POTENTIAL ISSUESS
#Back slash \ and other special issues might be able to confuse what parts of a file are strings
#Certian situations may cause a problem when using an old .csv file as an input
#Probably shouldn't merge 2 members versions in version control

#KNOWN ISSUES:
#2 backslashes \\ in a row in a translation will be read by godot as 1, even though the generated file appears to be correct

#FORMATTING IN CODE: 
#	"$$This is a simple example"
#	"Cat$$This example has a category"
#	"$$This is a \"quote\""
#	"$$\\back\\slashes\\"
